### Q & A - FAQ
- Please explain your daily routine as a developer
- I usually start my day by checking my emails and slack messages. Then I check my Jira board to see what I have to do for the day. I usually have a daily standup with my team to discuss the progress of the project and to see if there are any blockers. Then I start coding and I usually have a couple of meetings during the day to discuss the progress of the project or to discuss new features or bugs. As senior developer I also have to review the code of my teammates and help them with any blockers they might have and discuss with them the best approach to plan the architecture of the project and implement new features.
